		<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <em>1500s</em>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <u>popularised</u> in the <em>1960s</em> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>.</p>
